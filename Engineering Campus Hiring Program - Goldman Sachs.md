Interview - 3 Rounds 

All Rounds were conducted on the same day virtually.
(Received mail 3 days before interview)

Round 1 - 
Zoom call
Introduce yourself
Tell me about your project- some cross questions
Tell me about Trees
Then was asked to click on the codepair link (HackerRank Codepair Feature)
Ques- LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor)
Gave 2 approaches, Edge cases, Explanation
Started from Brute force then optimized it.
After this round, many people were eliminated.

Round 2 - 
Intro 
Red Blue Green balls puzzle
The pattern was kind of the same as round 1 but I was not able to clear this round as I got nervous and due to that missed many edge cases while coding.
She pointed out the bugs in my code, I corrected it after that but kind of messed up in my explanation part and edge cases.
Although I gave an optimized solution, I think I was not able to perform well in this round as she had to point out certain things in my code.

Suggestions- 
Cross question the interviewer before you start coding
Start from brute force
An optimized solution is not everything, you need to have a very clear thought process which is something that you can't develop in 1 day.
Communicating your thoughts efficiently is the KEY point in Goldman Sachs interviews.
Keep track of all the edge cases, don't give the interviewer the chance to point out bugs in your code.
Communicate all the points. Tell them about your assumptions (if any)

Things to prepare-
1. DSA (most imp) as they are interested in testing your problem-solving skills.
2. Puzzles
3. Practice communicating while you code. 
4. About your projects, Intro, Questions to ask from the interviewer
5. They are not concerned much about the theoritical part but still keep yourself prepared with the basics.
